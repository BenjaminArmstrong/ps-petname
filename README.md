# ps-petname

## Name

**ps-petname** is a PowerShell implimentation of the PetName name generator from Dustin Kirkland (https://github.com/dustinkirkland/petname).

## Description

This script will generate "pet names", consisting of a random combination of an adverb, adjective, and an animal name. These are useful for unique hostnames or container names, for instance.

As such, PetName tries to follow the tenets of Zookoâ€™s triangle. Names are:

- human meaningful
- decentralized
- secure

## Usage

ps-petname takes three parameters:
- Number of words to use in the name (default is 3)
- Separator to use (default is "-")
- Whether to use the small, medium or large database (default is "large")

## petname-builder

petname-builder.ps1 is a script that pulls the source data from Dustin's repo and then creates the "small", "medium" and "large" variable files that can be dotsourced in.
